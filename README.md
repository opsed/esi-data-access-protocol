# OpSED ESI Data Access Protocol (EDAP)

The OpSED ESI Data Access Protocol (EDAP) is a system for allowing the interchange of the electronically stored information (ESI) handled by eDiscovery technology.

The purpose of defining this data access protocol is to facilitate the creation of standardized software server protocols for handling ESI. An example use would be to create a data server layer on top of a proprietary data store which enables cross-technology interchange of the ESI stored in that system.
